I will explain how to read an excel file and a CSV file in the first tutorial.
In the second tutorial we will look at our database, accessing its columns,
with an attribute of an object, using the indexing operator and with
PANDAS operators 'loc' and 'iloc'.
With 'iloc' we can select single rows and columns of a database,
with 'loc' we can select more specific data.
We will study how to manipulate the index, using set_index function,
conditional selections and PANDAS conditional selectors (isin,notnull,isnull).
We can also assign a constant value to a new column or assigning a decreasing
number at every row.
