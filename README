I will explain how to read an excel file and a CSV file in the first tutorial.
In the second tutorial we will look at our database, accessing its columns,
with an attribute of an object, using the indexing operator and with
PANDAS operators 'loc' and 'iloc'.
With 'iloc' we can select single rows and columns of a database,
with 'loc' we can select more specific data.
We will study how to manipulate the index, using set_index function,
conditional selections and PANDAS conditional selectors (isin,notnull,isnull).
We can also assign a constant value to a new column or assigning a decreasing
number at every row. 

The file "log_normal_distr.py" explains how to generate a set of random numbers
from a normal distribution, how to plot a Gaussian function, how to generate random numbers with seeds and how to plot a lognormal distribution.

The file "stock_random_selection.py" shows how to generate random numbers
from a uniform distribution, how to estimate pi value, how to generate
random numbers from a Poisson distribution. Using random.uniform() function
it is possible to select stocks randomly from a list of stocks.
